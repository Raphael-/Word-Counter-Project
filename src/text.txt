If the supreme poets are four, and if the supreme
orators are two, the supreme dramatists are three
Sophocles, Shakspere, and Moliere. In the opinion
of those who have studied the long history of the
stage these three stand alone as the mighty masters
of the theatre ; and a wide gap separates them from
the nearest of those who have emulated their mastery
They are not only craftsmen of surpassing
skilly possessed of every device of the difficult art of
the playhouse, they are poets also, each according
to the special genius of his race and language ; they
are creators of unforgettable characters; they are
psychologists of piercing insight ; and they are moralists
of lofty elevation. Sophocles, the Greek, who
"saw life steadily and saw it whole," and Shakspere,
the Englishman, who alone deserves to be called
"myriad-minded," have each of them a tragic intensit
to which Molifere, the Frenchman, never aspired,
preferring, for the most part, rather to remain within
the ample limits of comedy. But of the comic drama,
in its broadest extension, Moliere is the indisputable master.
